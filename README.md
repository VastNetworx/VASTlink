# VASTlink
This is the github repository for the VastNetworx product: VASTlink

Code uploaded is text that is meant to be copied into a working IDE for C++. This is Arduino code created via Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO to interface with the Arduino. Do not use ArduinoIDE, it will run very very slow.
